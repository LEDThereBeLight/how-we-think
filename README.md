# In Progress: a visual environment for learning serious computer science topics

## Topics
- How to think about computer science topics
  - Graphs as "choice" frameworks
- How computer science topics map to the way we learn new ideas in our own minds
- Functional Programming
  - Recursion
  - Co-recursion
- Data structures
  - Functional / visual implementations
- Problem solving
  - How to intuit common frameworks
    - Search
      - Exhaustive
      - Binary
      - Ternary
    - Combinatorial
    - Games
  - "Difficult" hackerrank/leetcode problems
- Other foundational topics
  - Primitives / Combinations / Abstractions
  - Application / evaluation reductions
  - Iteration vs recursion, TCO
  - etc.

## Task list
